        <b>Ode to a Yellow Onion</b>
            <i style="font-size: 70%;">                 By C. Dale Young</i>

        And what if I had simply passed you by,
        your false skins gathering light in a basket,   
        those skins of unpolished copper,
        would you have lived more greatly?
        
        Now you are free of that metallic coating,
        a broken hull of parchment,
        the dried petals of a lily—
        those who have not loved you
        will not know differently.
    
        But you are green fading into yellow—
        how deceptive you have been.
        
        Once I played the cithara,
        fingers chafing against each note.
        Once I worked the loom,
        cast the shuttle through the warp.
        Once I scrubbed the tiles
        deep in the tub of Alejandro.
        Now I try to deciper you.
        
        Beyond the village, within a cloud
        of wild cacao and tamarind,
        they chant your tale, how you,
        most common of your kind,
        make the great warrior-men cry
        but a woman can unravel you.</pre>
